    "text": "I am an graduate student in applied math, currently completing Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge, funded by a Churchill Scholarship. Next fall, I will begin my PhD in the mathematics department at MIT, working on mathematical problems in biology, complex fluids, and soft matter. My intention is that this website will serve as my primary online presence as an academic. In the meantime, I plan to upload regular blog posts about the (very interesting) math I am learning in Part III, so stay tuned.\nIn my free time, I am also a serious skier, mountaineer, and runner. If you have stumbled upon this website due to my involvement in these activities, check out my Climbing Blog. I try to keep this regularly updated whenever I do something in the outdoors that I feel is relatively unique.\nIf you would like to contact me, my email address is xander_at_uyttendaele_dot_us."
